Great — if you're trying to replicate Truecaller's backend (i.e. a scalable, real-time phone identity + caller ID system), then you’re essentially building a system that must handle:

🔍 Truecaller-like System: Core Backend Needs
🧩 Key Modules
User & Auth — Registration, Login, Tokens (OTP, OAuth)

Caller ID Search — Query by phone, return metadata

Number Tagging & Spam Reporting

Contact Sync — Upload and index address book securely

Profile Management — User profiles, name, avatar

Admin Portal — Review, moderation, analytics

Background Jobs — Sync, spam score updates

Real-time APIs — Possibly WebSockets for sync status

Analytics & Logs — For fraud/spam review

Rate limiting / abuse control

🏗️ Practices to Follow (Signal + Industry Best)
Area	Best Practice
Project Modularity	Keep features self-contained: /api/callerid, /service/callerid
Auth	Use JWT for clients, OAuth2 for internal tools
Scalability	Stateless REST APIs + Redis or Kafka for async tasks
Async Jobs	Use Redis Queue / Spring Scheduler for syncing, spam recalculation
Abuse Control	Add rate limiting per IP/user, abuse metrics
Caching	Redis for fast caller ID lookups, caching spam scores
Observability	Spring Actuator + Prometheus + Grafana
Feature Flags	Use Togglz or Unleash for enabling/disabling features
Service Isolation	Design with microservices in mind (even inside monolith)
Configuration	YAML configs + @ConfigurationProperties + profiles
Logging	Centralized JSON logs (ELK or Loki/Grafana)

🔐 Admin Portal (Moderation, Insights)
You can either:

Build a Spring Boot module (e.g., /admin/api/**)

Or a frontend (React/Vue) talking to secure admin APIs

🔑 Admin Features
Search users/numbers

View spam tags, tag history

Moderate or correct spam reports

Manage blacklists / whitelists

View analytics (top spammers, usage stats)

Security Tips:
Protect with role-based access (Spring Security)

Require OAuth2 login with Google/Microsoft

Rate limit admin APIs too

✅ Signal-Server Inspired Practices You Should Use
Signal Practice	Your Implementation
YAML-based config	Use application.yml with profiles
Clear controller/service separation	Organize as api/ + service/
Background tasks in jobs/	Use Redis + Scheduled tasks
Metrics & health	Enable Actuator endpoints
WebSocket or async queuing	Use Kafka/Redis pub-sub if needed
Modular packages	Per-domain packaging: /callerid/, /auth/
Admin moderation workflows	Secure, RBAC-protected internal portal

🧠 TL;DR Summary
Use modular Spring Boot structure (controllers, services, repositories, config, jobs)

Follow Signal-style practices: async workers, YAML config, stateless design, centralized health

Build a protected admin portal with fine-grained roles & moderation tools

Focus on scale, security, and future microservice isolation

Add observability (metrics, logging, abuse detection)

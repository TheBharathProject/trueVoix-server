# trueVoix-server
TrueVoix is an open-source, privacy-first caller identification app designed to offer a clean, ad-free, and transparent experience. Unlike Truecaller, it does not harvest your contacts, track your usage, or show intrusive ads. Instead, it uses a community-powered and optionally self-hosted directory to help users identify unknown numbers safely.
